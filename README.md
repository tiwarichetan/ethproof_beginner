# ChetanTiwariToken (CTT) Token

This  program is a simple Token program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of a Token in the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to get familiar with creating tokens

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has two function for **Minting** and **Burning** token. There are three state variables to let you know about token and its state.

## Getting Started

#### Executing program

- To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

- Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., myToken.sol). Copy and paste the following [code](myToken_Project/myToken.sol) into the file.

- To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.10" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile firstToken.sol" button.

- Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "firstToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

- Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mintToken burnToken function. Finally, click on the totalSupply Variable to get total value.
